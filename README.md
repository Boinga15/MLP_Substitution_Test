# MLP_Substitution_Test
A simple MLP built to solve substitution ciphers that I made just to test myself.

The whole program was made after I learnt some of the basics about AI. It isn't much, it simply takes some examples of a substitution cipher and then learns how to solve them given just the encryption. Currently only works with lowercase letters, fails with punctuation of any kind. The whole project is more of a "proof-of-concept", an attempt to program an AI without relying on pre-built AI libraries such as Tensorflow.
